Malware Prototype for Seneca DPI912 Python Class     

I tried to incorporate the libraries you added into my code for the Daemon
but I can not make it work for the life of me :(

I left copies of the files I tried to use your libraries with and postfixed them
with (nw) for Not Working to show that I'm not just claiming I tired...

The lottery generation is now working, minor issue in that you need to press
Ctrl+C in order to get the command line back in the client.
