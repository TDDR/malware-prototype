Malware Prototype for Seneca DPI912 Python Class


Most of what I have done today was implementing the tutorial that Harvey kept of reffering to in the documents and then trouble shooting the code. I am now at an impasse.

    I've spent a good amount of time trying to set up this connection but I have spent the last hour stuck on this one issue so I'm gonna hope you two can figure it out.

    I'm trying to start up the server but I keep getting errors. First
        paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException: not a valid RSA private key file

        generated from line 17
        serverHostKey = paramiko.RSAKey(filename = "./keys/rsaKeys")

        I think the problem is that the version of paramiko installed on our Debian is outdated? Becuase in the tutorial it says the key should have the header
            -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

            ...

            -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

        but when I generate the key pair the header is
            -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

            ...

            -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

        I then tried to simply change the header to what it wants and got this error
            paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException: Could not deserialize key data.

    I have yet to test any of the client code I wrote becuase I cannot get the server up and running. Like I said, I spend most of the day working on this already and I have two classes tomorrow so I won't be able to work on it again until tomorrow night. Harvey said that the lecture on Friday will be a quick 30 min one and then for the last 3 hours he will be helping anyone who has questions.
